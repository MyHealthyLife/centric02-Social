# Process Centric Service 2 (social):

This is the second centric service for MyHealthyLife application. As for the centric 1 this service has to integrate all the data coming from the 4 primitive services. It performs requests for retrieving goals, the ranking of a user, the recipes and foods inserted by the community and provides the possibility to dedicate an existing sentence (from service02) to a specific user. These are all functions that provide a 'social' interface for the end user. It runs as a RESTful service and as so it uses GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods following the REST directives.
